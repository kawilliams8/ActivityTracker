# Activity Tracker
### By [Katie Williams](https://github.com/kawilliams8) and [Steve Rumizen](https://github.com/rumizen)

## Description

Activity Tracker is a web-based platform designed to store, analyze and display a user's fitness data in an attractive and useful format. We were challenged with parsing multiple datasets with the use of OOP and TDD, and scripting how we displayed that data on the browser. Students were also challenged to incorporate advanced Github features including "issues", project-management tools, and a new local Git workflow.

Activity Tracker is a Front-End MOD 2 project at the Turing School of Software & Design. The authors are students of the 1903 cohort.

## Setup

Activity Tracker requires no installation.
